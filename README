1.  HOW TO RUN?
    
    Under the "tests/bubble_3D" directory
    (a) For the 2D simulation
        make allclean; make; make run2d;
    (b) For the 3D simulation
        make allclean; make; make run3d;

2.  WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROGRAM?

    Execute the following to find out the parameters to be passed
    ./lbm_raijin_cluster -h

3.  WHAT IS THE TESTED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION?

    (a) Git revision icldistcomp-ulfm-46b781a8f170 (as of 13 December 2014)
    (b) gcc version 4.6.4 (GCC)
    (c) PETSc (version 3.5.2 or 3.6.4) was installed with the following configuration
        ./configure --prefix=PATH --with-mpi-dir=PATH PETSC_ARCH=linux-gnu \
        --download-fblaslapack=1 --with-shared-libraries=1 PETSC_DIR=PATH/petsc \
        PETSC_ARCH=linux-gnu --with-64-bit-indices=0
    (d) Head node of Raijin cluster (http://nci.org.au/~raijin/)

4.  IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF ULFM MPI TO TEST WITH?

    Yes. If the above git revision does not meet the requirements, there is
    another way as follows to try.

    This needs a combination of files from two git revisions. Install
    git revision icldistcomp-ulfm-3bc561b48416 (as of Mid-June 2013)
    with the following updates from git revision 
    icldistcomp-ulfm-c351e0e792a8 (as of 21 May 2014).

    (a) /ompi/mca/coll/ftbasic/coll_ftbasic_agreement_earlyterminating.c
    (b) /ompi/mca/coll/base/coll_tags.h
    (c) /ompi/mca/coll/ftbasic/coll_ftbasic.h
    (d) /ompi/mca/coll/ftbasic/coll_ftbasic_component.c
    (e) /ompi/mca/coll/ftbasic/coll_ftbasic_module.c
    (f) /ompi/communicator/comm_ft.c
    (g) /ompi/communicator/comm_ft_revoke.c
    (h) /ompi/errhandler/errhandler_rte.c
    (i) /ompi/mca/pml/ob1/pml_ob1.c

5.  WHAT CAN I DO IF THE EXECUTION HANGS ON?

    The sleep times in "ProcsFailureRecovery.cpp" file could be increased
    to fix this problem. The default sleep times are set as "sleep(2);"
    and "sleep(5);".

6.  WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO RUN ON COMPUTE NODES?

    Remove single-line comment from "#define RUN_ON_COMPUTE_NODES" 
    in "FailureRecovery.cpp" file and run program with a machinefile 
    named "hostfile"

7.  WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO SPAWN REPLACEMENT PROCESSES ON SPARE NODES TO HANDLE
    NODE FAILURES?

    Remove single-line comment from "#define RUN_ON_COMPUTE_NODES" and 
    "#define RECOV_ON_SPARE_NODES" in "FailureRecovery.cpp" file and run 
    program with a machinefile named "hostfile"

8.  IS THERE ANY LICENSE TO USE THE CODE?

    Yes. See the LICENSE file.

9.  IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE USE OF THE CODE?

    Yes. Cite the following article and PhD Thesis.
